Alembic manages different migrations of the SQLite database, keeping track of each version inside the ./versions folder. 

Migrations can be run either as upgrade or downgrade in the command prompt within the project's folder by typing 'alembic upgrade/downgrade [migration_id]'. The migration ID is specified within each migration file.

Migrations can also be executed by specifying how many versions you wish to move forwards/backwards (+1 one version forwards, -1 one version backwards etc.), or by simply specifying head to migrate to the newest version.
